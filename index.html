        <h1>WHAT IS GIT?: Features,Command And Workflow In Git.</h1>
<p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
     is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development. Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel.

     Before diving deep, letâ€™s explain a scenario before Git:
     <ul>
          <li>Developers used to submit their codes to the central server without having copies of their own</li>
          <br>
             <li>  Any changes made to the source code were unknown to the other developers</li>
             <br>
             <li>  There was no communication between any of the developers</li>
             <br>
     </ul>

 Now let's look at the scenario after Git:
 <br>
 <ul>
     <li>Every developer has an entire copy of the code on their local systems</li>
     <li>Any changes made to the source can be tracked by others</li>
     <li>There's regular communication between developers</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is Git?</h2> 
<br>
 
`<p>Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development
 <ul>
     <li>Git is used to tracking changes in the source code</li>
     <li>The distributed version control tool is used for source code management</li>
     <li>It allows multiple developers to work together</li>
     <li>It supports non-linear development through its thousands of parallel branches</li>

<h4>Git Workflow</h4>
<br>
<img src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/git-workflow.JPG" alt="">
<br> 
<p>
     The Git workflow is divided into three states:
     <ul>
          <li> Working directory - Modify files in your working directory</li><br>
          <li>Staging area (Index) - Stage the files and add snapshots of them to your staging area</li><br>
          <li>Git directory (Repository) - Perform a commit that stores the snapshots permanently to your Git directory. Checkout any existing version, make changes, stage them and commit.</li><br>
     </ul>
